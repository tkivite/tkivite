### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Titus

## About me

I'm an experienced Software developer, driving success for companies/individuals in need of on time delivery of quality software from analysis, design and development. Get your back-end software application crafted in NodeJS, Ruby on Rails or Golang and using either SQL or NO-SQL databases. I have recently been working on a web3 and blockchain project that have added my skill base in decentralization. My experience hosting software in AWS and Heroku will be helpful to get your applications up and running.

Reach out to me and let's discuss your next software development project.
